#GUIDE
*Prerequisite function you will have to create for yourself before using this library.
	1. Function to control the upper and lower link motors for your quadruped.
		a) This will be two seperate functions(one for upper actuators one for lower) each having two parameters.
			1.The index(refer configurations.png) of the leg you want to move.
			2.Angle in degrees.
		b) The direction of the rotation can either be handled in this functions itself or can also be handled in the library.
		c) The offsets for precise 
	2. A Delay function, this function should take argument in microseconds. This will decide the speed of your quadruped.This means each loop when the program runs will add a delay of that many microseconds in your program.

*Refer configurations.png to choose choose your configuration of legs and select proper parameters accordingly.

To begin create an object of class TVquad,this object will be your quadruped all function calls will be made from this object.

functions provided by this library.

void setUpperMotorf(void (*fn_controlling_upper_motors)(int leg,int angle))
	-To point to your fn. for controlling upper actuators.

void setLowerMotorf(void (*fn_controlling_lower_motors)(int leg,int angle))
	-To point to your fn. for controlling lower actuators.

void setPoints(double[72][2])
	-Takes 72 points 0->x 1->y if you want to provide custom trajectory *each point should have refers 5 phases from(0 to 360)*.
	-The effects of this function will nullify if you call any inbuilt preconfigured walking functions.
	-Function setPhaseDiff(int,int,int,int)	needs to be called after this to adjuset the phase difference according to your trajectory

void setPhaseDiff(int,int,int,int)
	-Takes 4 parameters as phase differance for four legs can take values form 0 to 355

void getAngles()
	-Call this function after making changes to trajectory before making the quadruped run again to see visible changes.
	-You can make multiple changes to the trajectory before calling this functions but the heirarchy of those functions need to be followed.
