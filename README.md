# TV_quadruped
This library provides you with the ability to control a quadruped with legs with 2 DOF movement.
It gives you the freedom of choosing the actuator of your choice AS LONG AS IT HAS ROTATION CONTROL(you can control the degree it is at).
Apart form the control systems you will require for controlling your actuators this will help you build a quadruped with only one master microcontroller.
You can run this even on systems with low processing speed such as Atmega-328p and it will work as a lot how heavy work is done before the quadruped starts walking, this gives you the freedom to increase the speed of your quadruped without taking into consideration the processing speed of your microcontroller.
